<p>Born in 1987 in the Netherlands, I've always had a passion for anything computer related. 
    As a fullstack developer, I specialize in technologies like .NET, Angular, Azure, C#, TypeScript, and Python. 
    In my spare time I like spending quality time with my family, being busy with programming projects, solving puzzles, and playing video games. 
    I am married and a proud father of two daughters and two sons, I find joy in balancing my career with a fulfilling family life.</p>
