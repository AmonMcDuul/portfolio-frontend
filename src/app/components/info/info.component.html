    <p>Born in 1987 in the Netherlands, I've always had a passion for anything computer related. 
        As a fullstack developer, I specialize in technologies like .NET, Angular, Azure and Docker, but I'm always eager to explore and experiment with different technologies and programming languages.
        In my spare time I like spending time with my family, working on programming projects, solving puzzles, and playing video games. 
        I am married and a proud father of two daughters and two sons.</p>
